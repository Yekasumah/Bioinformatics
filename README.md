Malaria Detection Using CNN and Transfer Learning

This project focuses on detecting malaria from cell images using deep learning techniques. We used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) combined with Transfer Learning to train a model that classifies images of blood cells as either infected or uninfected with malaria.


Malaria is a serious disease caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites. Detecting malaria early is important for effective treatment. This project aims to automatically detect malaria in blood cell images using a trained machine learning model.

Project Workflow

Data Preparation: Resize and prepare the images for model training.
Model Selection: Use a pre-trained CNN model (Transfer Learning) to extract important features.
Training: Train the model on the malaria dataset.
Evaluation: Test how well the model can classify new, unseen images.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle. It contains microscopic images of blood cells categorized into:

Infected Cells: Cells with malaria parasites.
Uninfected Cells: Healthy cells without malaria.
Model Architecture

We used a pre-trained CNN model (such as ResNet50 or VGG16) to speed up the training process:

Feature Extraction: The pre-trained model identifies important patterns in the cell images.
Classification: Added fully connected layers to classify images as infected or uninfected.
Training and Evaluation

Optimizer: Adam optimizer, which helps improve the learning process.
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy, since we are classifying between two categories (infected vs uninfected).
Metrics: We tracked accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Results

The model performed well on the test data, achieving high accuracy:

Metric	Value
Accuracy	95%
Precision	93%
Recall	94%
F1-Score	93.5%
Potential Applications in Lagos, Nigeria

Malaria is a prevalent disease in Nigeria, especially in urban areas like Lagos. The model developed in this project could be applied to analyze cell image datasets obtained from malaria cases in Lagos. By using such data, this tool can help healthcare professionals and laboratories in Lagos quickly and accurately identify infected blood cells. This automated detection could improve the efficiency of malaria diagnosis and assist in the early treatment of patients, reducing the burden on healthcare workers and potentially saving lives.

With the right infrastructure, this model could be integrated into hospital and laboratory systems in Lagos, aiding in real-time malaria detection and improving public health outcomes.
